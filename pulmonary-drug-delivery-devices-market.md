<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pulmonary Drug Delivery Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dry Powder Inhaler</li><li>Metered Dose Inhaler</li><li>Nebulizer</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The pulmonary drug delivery devices market comprises three main types: dry powder inhalers (DPIs), metered dose inhalers (MDIs), and nebulizers. DPIs deliver medication in a powdered form, requiring patients to inhale deeply to activate the dosage. MDIs dispense a measured dose of medication in aerosol form, often used with a spacer for better delivery. Nebulizers convert liquid medication into a mist, allowing for inhalation over a longer period, suitable for patients unable to use inhalers effectively.</p></p>
