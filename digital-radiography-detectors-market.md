<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Digital Radiography Detectors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Indirect Flat Panel Detectors</li><li>Direct Flat Panel Detectors</li><li>Computed radiography (CR) Detectors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The digital radiography detectors market comprises three main types: Indirect Flat Panel Detectors, Direct Flat Panel Detectors, and Computed Radiography (CR) Detectors. Indirect Flat Panel Detectors utilize scintillator materials to convert X-rays into light, which is then captured by a photodetector. Direct Flat Panel Detectors convert X-rays directly into electrical signals, offering high image quality and fast acquisition times. Computed Radiography (CR) Detectors use photostimulable phosphor plates to capture X-ray images, which are later digitized for viewing and analysis.</p></p>
