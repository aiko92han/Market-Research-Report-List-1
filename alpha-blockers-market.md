<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Alpha Blockers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-selective Antagonists</li><li>Selective Antagonists</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Alpha blockers are categorized into non-selective and selective antagonists based on their mechanism of action on alpha-adrenergic receptors. Non-selective antagonists block both alpha-1 and alpha-2 receptors, impacting various physiological processes and leading to broader effects on blood pressure and vascular resistance. In contrast, selective antagonists primarily target alpha-1 receptors, offering more focused therapeutic effects with fewer side effects. Market demand for these drugs is driven by their use in treating conditions like hypertension and benign prostatic hyperplasia.</p></p>
