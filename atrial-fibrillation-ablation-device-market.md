<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Atrial Fibrillation Ablation Device Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Catheter Ablation</li><li>Maze Surgery</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Atrial Fibrillation Ablation Device market consists primarily of catheter ablation and maze surgery categories. Catheter ablation involves the use of thin tubes inserted into the heart to target and destroy areas causing irregular electrical signals. Maze surgery, a more invasive approach, creates scar tissue through surgical incisions to interrupt these signals, effectively restoring normal rhythm. Both methods are aimed at improving patient outcomes by reducing symptoms and risks associated with atrial fibrillation, allowing for enhanced quality of life.</p></p>
