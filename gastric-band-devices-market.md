<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gastric Band Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Adjustable Gastric Bands</li><li>Non-adjustable Gastric Bands</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The gastric band devices market is primarily categorized into two types: adjustable gastric bands and non-adjustable gastric bands. Adjustable gastric bands are designed with an inflatable cuff that can be tightened or loosened, allowing for personalized weight management by controlling the rate of food intake. In contrast, non-adjustable gastric bands have a fixed size, providing consistent restriction without the ability to modify tension. Both types are used in bariatric surgery to aid weight loss by reducing stomach capacity and promoting early satiety.</p></p>
