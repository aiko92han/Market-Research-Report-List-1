<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The LDPE Extrusion Coating Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Tubular Process</li><li>Autoclave Process</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The LDPE extrusion coating market features primarily two types: the tubular process and the autoclave process. The tubular process involves extruding molten LDPE through a circular die to form a tube, which is then flattened and coated onto substrates, ideal for packaging applications. In contrast, the autoclave process utilizes a closed environment, where the polymer is extruded to achieve high-quality, uniform coatings. Both methods cater to diverse industries, ensuring effective barrier properties and durability for various products.</p></p>
