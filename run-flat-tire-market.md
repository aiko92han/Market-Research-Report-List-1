<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Run-flat Tire Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Self-Supporting</li><li>Support Ring System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The run-flat tire market comprises two main types: self-supporting and support ring systems. Self-supporting run-flat tires feature reinforced sidewalls that maintain structural integrity, enabling them to support the vehicle's weight even when deflated. This allows drivers to continue traveling for a limited distance. In contrast, support ring systems utilize an additional ring inside the tire to provide support when air pressure is lost. Both types enhance safety by reducing the risk of tire blowouts and minimizing the need for immediate replacements.</p></p>
